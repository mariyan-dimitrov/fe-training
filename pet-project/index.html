                        Saul Hudson (born 23 July 1965), better known by his stage name Slash, is a British–American
                        musician
                        and songwriter. He is the lead guitarist of the American hard rock band Guns N' Roses, with whom
                        he
                        achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Slash has received critical
                        acclaim
                        and is
                        considered one of the greatest guitarists in rock history.

                        In 1993, Slash formed the side project Slash's Snakepit; three years later he left Guns N' Roses
                        in
                        1996
                        and co-founded the supergroup Velvet Revolver, which re-established him as a mainstream
                        performer in
                        the
                        mid to late 2000s. Slash has released four solo albums: Slash (2010), featuring an array of
                        guest
                        musicians, and Apocalyptic Love (2012), World on Fire (2014) and Living the Dream (2018)
                        recorded
                        with
                        his band, Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators. He returned to Guns N' Roses in 2016.

                        Hudson was born in Hampstead, London. He was named after Saul Steinberg, an artist. His
                        mother, Ola J. Hudson (née Oliver; 1946–2009), was an African-American costume
                        designer, whose clients included David Bowie; and his father, Anthony Hudson, is an English
                        artist who created album covers for musicians such as Neil Young and Joni Mitchell. Of
                        his mixed background, Slash later remarked, "As a musician, I've always been amused that I'm
                        both British and black; particularly because so many American musicians seem to aspire to be
                        British while so many British musicians, in the 'Sixties in particular, went to such great pains
                        to be black.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During his early years, Slash was raised by his father and paternal grandparents in
                        Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, while his mother moved to Los Angeles for work.[17] When Slash
                        was around five years old, he and his father joined his mother in Los Angeles, California.[18]
                        His brother, Albion "Ash" Hudson, was born in 1972. Following his parents' separation in
                        1974, Slash became a self-described "problem child." He chose to live with his mother
                        and was often sent to live with his beloved maternal grandmother whenever his mother had to
                        travel for her job. Slash sometimes accompanied his mother to work, where he met several
                        film and music stars. He was given the nickname "Slash" by actor Seymour Cassel, because he
                        was "always in a hurry, zipping around from one thing to another."

                        In 1979, Slash decided to form a band with his friend Steven Adler The band never
                        materialized, but it prompted Slash to take up an instrument. Since Adler had designated himself
                        the role of guitarist, Slash decided to learn how to play bass. Equipped with a one-string
                        flamenco guitar given to him by his grandmother, he began taking classes with Robert Wolin, a
                        teacher at Fairfax Music School. During his first lesson, Slash decided to switch from bass
                        to guitar after hearing Wolin play "Brown Sugar" by The Rolling Stones. His decision to play
                        guitar was further influenced by one of his school teachers, who would play songs by Cream and
                        Led Zeppelin for his students. As a result, Slash stated, "When I heard him do that, I said,
                        'That's what I want to do."A champion BMX rider, Slash put the bike aside to devote
                        himself to playing guitar, practicing up to 12 hours a day. Slash attended Beverly Hills
                        High School and was a classmate of Lenny Kravitz and Zoro.

                        Slash joined his first band, Tidus Sloan, in 1981.[31] In 1983, he formed the band Road
                        Crew—named after the Motörhead song "(We Are) The Road Crew"—with his childhood friend Steven
                        Adler, who by then had learned to play drums. He placed an advertisement in a newspaper looking
                        for a bassist, and received a response from Duff McKagan. They auditioned a number of singers,
                        including one-time Black Flag vocalist Ron Reyes, and worked on material that included the main
                        riff of what would become the Guns N' Roses song "Rocket Queen."[32] Slash disbanded the group
                        the following year due to them not being able to find a singer, as well as Adler's lack of work
                        ethic compared to himself and McKagan.[32] He, along with Adler, then joined a local band known
                        as Hollywood Rose, which featured singer Axl Rose and guitarist Izzy Stradlin. Following his
                        time with Hollywood Rose, Slash played in a band called Black Sheep and unsuccessfully
                        auditioned for Poison, a glam metal band that he would later openly deride.[31]
                    </p>
                    <p>In June 1985, Slash was asked by Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin to join the newly founded Guns N'
                        Roses,
                        along with[33] Duff McKagan and Steven Adler (replacing founding members Tracii Guns, Ole Beich
                        and
                        Rob Gardner, respectively). They played Los Angeles-area nightclubs‍—‌such as the Whisky a Go
                        Go,
                        The Roxy, and The Troubadour‍—‌and opened for larger acts throughout 1985 and 1986. Before one
                        of
                        the shows in 1985, Slash shoplifted a black felt top hat and a Native American-style silver
                        concho
                        belt from two stores on Melrose Avenue in L.A. He combined the hat with parts of the belt to
                        create
                        a piece of custom headwear for the show. He said he "felt really cool" in the hat, and it became
                        his
                        trademark.[34] It was during 1985–1986 that the band wrote most of its classic material,
                        including
                        "Welcome to the Jungle," "Sweet Child o' Mine", and "Paradise City," As a result of their rowdy
                        and
                        rebellious behavior, Guns N' Roses quickly received the moniker "Most Dangerous Band in the
                        World,"
                        causing Slash to remark, "For some strange reason, Guns N' Roses is like the catalyst for
                        controversy, even before we had any kind of record deal."[35] After being scouted by several
                        major
                        record labels, the band signed with Geffen Records in March 1986.[31]</p>

                        In July 1987, Guns N' Roses released its debut album, Appetite for Destruction, which as of
                        September 2008 has sold over 28 million copies worldwide,[36] 18 million of which were sold in
                        the
                        United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the U.S.[37] In the summer
                        of
                        1988, the band achieved its only U.S. No. 1 hit with "Sweet Child o' Mine," a song spearheaded
                        by
                        Slash's guitar riff and solo. In November of that year, Guns N' Roses released G N' R Lies,
                        which
                        sold over five million copies in the U.S. alone,[38] despite containing only eight tracks, four
                        of
                        which were included on the previously released EP Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide. As their success
                        grew,
                        so did interpersonal tensions within the band. In 1989, during a show as opening act for the
                        Rolling
                        Stones, Axl Rose threatened to leave the band if certain members of the band didn't stop
                        "dancing
                        with Mr. Brownstone,"[31] a reference to their song of the same name about heroin use. Slash was
                        among those who promised to clean up.[31] However, the following year, Steven Adler was fired
                        from
                        the band because of his heroin addiction; he was replaced by Matt Sorum of The Cult.</p>

                    <p>In May 1991, the band embarked on the two-and-a-half-year-long Use Your Illusion Tour. The
                        following
                        September, Guns N' Roses released the long-awaited albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your
                        Illusion
                        II, which debuted at No. 2 and No. 1, respectively, on the U.S. chart, a feat not achieved by
                        any
                        other group.[39] Izzy Stradlin abruptly left the band in November; he was replaced by Gilby
                        Clarke
                        of Candy and Kill for Thrills. Slash played his final show with Guns N' Roses on July 17,
                        1993.[31]
                        In November of that year, the band released "The Spaghetti Incident?", a cover album of mostly
                        punk
                        songs, which proved less successful than its predecessors. Slash then wrote several songs for
                        what
                        would have become the follow-up album to the Use Your Illusion twins. Axl Rose and Duff,
                        however,
                        rejected the material.[40]</p>

                    <p>With the band's failure to collaborate resulting in no album being recorded,[41] Slash announced
                        in
                        October 1996 that he was no longer a part of Guns N' Roses.[42] Slash stated at the time "Axl
                        and I
                        have not been capable of seeing eye to eye on Guns N' Roses for some time. We tried to
                        collaborate,
                        but at this point, I'm no longer in the band."[43] Paul Tobias's inclusion in the band was
                        another
                        factor in Slash leaving, with Slash having both "creative and personal" differences with
                        Tobias.[44]
                        However, in his 2007 autobiography, Slash stated that his decision to leave the band was not
                        based
                        on artistic differences with Axl Rose, but on Rose's constant lateness to concerts, the alleged
                        legal manipulation Rose used (since denied by Rose) to gain control of the band; and the
                        departures
                        of Steven Adler and Izzy Stradlin.[45]</p>
